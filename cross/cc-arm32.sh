# NEVER pass that rsp via --extra-cflags: configure feeds --extra-cflags to the
# ASSEMBLER too (configure:5509), and those flags are clang-cl-only.
# Paths come from config.sh at the repo root; this wrapper derives that root from its own
# location, so it works from any checkout and from whatever cwd configure invokes it in.
